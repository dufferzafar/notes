## NFT Sales analysis

<!-- Conversion rates -->
ADA_INR = 167.77

<!-- NFT tokens to buy -->
TOKENS = 300

<!-- How much is 1 NFT? -->
UNIT_COST = 30
COST_INR = UNIT_COST*ADA_INR

<!--  -->
BUY_PRICE = COST_INR * TOKENS

UNIT_SELL = 100
SELL_PRICE = UNIT_SELL * ADA_INR * TOKENS

PROFIT = 100 * (SELL_PRICE - BUY_PRICE) / BUY_PRICE
