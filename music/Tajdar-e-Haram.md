qismat mein meri chain se jeena likh de
ḍoobe nah kabhi mera safeenah likh de
jannat bhi gawaarah hai magar mere liye
ay kaatib-i taqdeer madeenah likh de

taajdaar-i haram

taajdaar-i haram ho nigaah-i karam
taajdaar-i haram ho nigaah-i karam

hum ghareebon ke din bhi sanwar jaaen ge
haami-yi be-kasaan kya kahe ga jahaan
haami-yi be-kasaan kya kahe ga jahaan
aap ke dar se khaali agar jaaen ge

taajdaar-i haram
taajdaar-i haram

koyi apna naheen gham ke maare hain hum
koyi apna naheen gham ke maare hain hum
aap ke dar pe faryaad laaye hain hum
ho nigaah-i karam warnah chaukhat pe hum
ho nigaah-i karam warnah chaukhat pe hum
aap ka naam le le ke mar jaaen ge

taajdaar-i haram
taajdaar-i haram

kya tum se kahoon ay 'arab ke kunwar
tum jaante ho man ki batiyaan
dar furqat-i to ay ummi-laqab
kaaṭe nah kaṭe hain ab ratiyaan
tori preet mein sudh-budh sab bisri
kab tak yih rahegi be-khabari
gaahe ba-figan duzdeedah nazar
kabhi sun bhi to lo hamri batiyaan

aap ke dar se koyi nah khaali gaya
aap ke dar se koyi nah khaali gaya
aap ke dar se koyi nah khaali gaya

apne daaman ko bhar ke sawaali gaya
apne daaman ko bhar ke sawaali gaya

ho habeeb-i hazeen

ho habeeb-i hazeen par bhi aaqa nazar
warnah auraaq-i hasti bikhar jaaen ge
ho habeeb-i hazeen par bhi aaqa nazar
warnah auraaq-i hasti bikhar jaaen ge

Let a life of peace and contentment be my fate
May my ship never sink even in troubled waters - let this be my fate
It's not that heaven would not be acceptable to me, but
O Writer of Destinies, let Medina be my fate
O king of the holy sanctuary
O king of the holy sanctuary, bless us with your merciful gaze
O king of the holy sanctuary, bless us with your merciful gaze
So that our days of woe may turn for the better
O patron of the poor, what would the world say
O patron of the poor, what would the world say
If we return empty-handed from your door?
O king of the holy sanctuary
O king of the holy sanctuary
We have no one to call our own, we are stricken with grief
We have no one to call our own, we are stricken with grief
We come and cry for justice at your door
Please spare us a merciful glance, or we will
Please spare us a merciful glance, or we will
Die at your threshold, crying your name
O king of the holy sanctuary
O king of the holy sanctuary
What should I tell you, O Prince of Arabia
You already know what is in my heart
In your separation, O you who bear the title of the Untaught One
Our sleepless nights are so hard to bear
In your love, I have lost all sense of consciousness
How long will I remain in this state of unconsciousness?
Cast a stolen glance towards me sometime
Turn your ear to my words sometime
No one has ever returned empty-handed from your door
No one has ever returned empty-handed from your door
No one has ever returned empty-handed from your door
Each seeker has returned with his desires fulfilled
Each seeker has returned with his desires fulfilled
For your sorrowful lover…
O master, please spare a glance for your sorrowful lover
Else the pages of existence will become disarrayed
O master, please spare a glance for your sorrowful lover
Else the pages of existence will become disarrayed
O king of the holy sanctuary
O king of the holy sanctuary
Come, devoted lovers, let's go to Medina!
Let's go to Medina!
Let's go to Medina!
Let's go to Medina!
Come, devoted lovers, let's go to Medina!
Let's go to Medina!
Let's go to Medina!
Let's go to Medina!
Come, let's go to Medina!
Come, let's go to Medina!
Let's go this very month
Come, let's go to Medina!
Come, let's go to Medina!
Come, let's go to Medina!
Let's go this very month
Come, let's go to Medina!

The wonders of His Glory are glitteringly manifest in Medina
The wonders of His Glory are glitteringly manifest in Medina
The ardent gaze knows boundless fulfilment in Medina
The ardent gaze knows boundless fulfilment in Medina
There's neither sorrow of life nor fear of death in Medina
There's neither sorrow of life nor fear of death in Medina
We will perform the prayer of Love in Medina
We will perform the prayer of Love in Medina

Clear and direct is the path to God in Medina

Let's go to Medina!
Let's go to Medina!
Let's go this very month
Let's go to Medina!

Come, devoted lovers, let's go to Medina!
Come, devoted lovers, let's go to Medina!

Let's go and drink from the hand of the Cupbearer of Kausar
Let's go and drink from the hand of the Cupbearer of Kausar

Keep in mind that…
Keep in mind that…
Keep in mind that…
Keep in mind that…

If he looks up but once
All the wine-cups that are empty will become filled!

Keep in mind that if he looks up but once
A look from him!
All the wine-cups that are empty will become filled!

O king of the holy sanctuary
O king of the holy sanctuary

There is fear of the storm, and dread of lightning
There is fear of the storm, and dread of lightning
Our distress is severe, master, to whom should we turn?
Our distress is severe, master, to whom should we turn?

If you would not trouble to see how we fare
Our afflictions would surely kill us
If you would not trouble to see how we fare
Our afflictions would surely kill us

O king of the holy sanctuary
O king of the holy sanctuary

O Mustafa, O Mujtaba, show us mercy

Yours is the hand all the helpless and hopeless grasp
I am a sinner, feeble and helpless, friendless and destitute, and you
Are the only one who cares for me

O musk-willow, scattering fragrance
O sweet breeze of the early morn
O you who cures ills, O you with the breath of Jesus
O consoler of the grief-stricken
O auspicious messenger

I beg you in the name of that same fragrance
O morning breeze, if you go
To that sacred land someday
Present my greetings at the blessed grave
Where the revered Prophet rests
O king of the holy sanctuary, bless us with your merciful gaze
O king of the holy sanctuary, bless us with your merciful gaze
So that our days of woe may turn for the better
O patron of the poor, what would the world say
O patron of the poor, what would the world say
If we return empty-handed from your door?
O king of the holy sanctuary
O king of the holy sanctuary
O king of the holy sanctuary
