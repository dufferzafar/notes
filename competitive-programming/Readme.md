# Competitive Programming

is hard.

## Thoughts

To me, programming has always been about solving *my* problems. Not anyone elses.

If someone else also has that problem, and benefits from my solution. That's just an icing on the cake.

This took me back to the school / coaching days. For most of the days, my schedule used to be:

    1. Wake up
    2. Study - solve problems on paper
    3. Program solutions
    4. Sleep

It was very clear to me that I'm only doing this as to pepare for interviews, and won't be doing it again till the next set of interviews come.

## Challenges Faced

* Algorithmic Thinking

    - Very different from standard software development
    - Where discussions etc. happen

* Dealing with frustration

    - My code isn't working
        + and I can't really ask anyone
            * or Google
            * or look at the solutions
        + I have to fix this myself

    - I can't come up with a fast enough algorithm
        + That feeling of `am I just not good enough?`

* Debugging

    - in that restricted environment?

* How much time should I spend on a problem?
    - When should I give up and begin to look for solutions?

* What should I do with problems I can't solve?

    - Unlock a test case
    - Look at discussion
    - Look at editorial

    - Discuss with a friend

* Which site should I use?
    - Geeks for Geeks

* What other resources?
    - Books
        +
