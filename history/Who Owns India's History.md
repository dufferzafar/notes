# Who owns India's History?

> A critique of [Shashi Tharoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashi_Tharoor)'s ["Inglorious Empire"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglorious_Empire) - by [Charles Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Allen_(writer)).

Tharoor's book "Inglorious Empire" is a formalisation of his views presented in the debate ["Britain does owe reparations"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CW7S0zxv4).

## Summary

* The paper begins with some talk on the [Padmanabhaswamy temple treasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padmanabhaswamy_Temple_treasure) ([/r/UnresolvedMysteries Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/akiisn/in_2011_a_team_of_experts_explored_the_gold/)), controlled by the Brahmin "Nambudris" and the sorry state of lower caste people circa 1720.

> "100s of petty taxes  ...  worse of which was - breast tax, mulakkaram, by which the women of lower social groups had to expose their breasts or pay a tax."

* Appointment of John Munro as 'dewan', who brought social reforms in Travancore, Kerala.

* People reinterpret historical events to suit their narrative.

    - > "Congress Party’s politico-ideological reinterpretation of history – India as victim, a once-wealthy nation reduced to poverty by British imperial rapacity." - this is the so-called [‘drain theory’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadabhai_Naoroji#Naoroji's_drain_theory_and_poverty).

* British Point of View

    - > "British historians presented their country’s role in India as a mission to civilise oriental despotism and barbarity."

    * Katherine Mayo 
        - > argued that "Indians were unfit to govern themselves chiefly on account of their treatment of women, children and outcastes." 
        - "an American white supremacist" 
        - Author of the book [Mother India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_India_(book))
            + which is banned in India.

* Indian govt. revises History

    - > Nehru and the Congress Party reversed the roles of Britain as civiliser and India as oppressor of its people to create a stronger sense of national unity.

    - > NCERT issued a directive requiring school texts to gloss sensitive issues like sectarian conflict, declaring that: “Characterisation of the medieval period as a dark period or as a time of conflict between Hindus and Muslims is forbidden.” 

        + I couldn't find a decent citation for this, but there is a Wikipage on [NCERT Controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCERT_textbook_controversies)
    
    - > Everyone in India who received a state education after the late 1970s was taught this sanitised, simplistic view of their history.

### Lies, Damned Lies & Statistics

* Tharoor says

    - > At the beginning of 18th century India’s share of the world economy was 23 per cent, as large as all Europe put together. By the time the British departed, India had dropped to just 3 per cent ... . Britain’s rise for 200 years was financed by its depredations in India.

* As is evident from the chart

    - > "between 1700 and 1820 China’s and Western Europe’s economies soar, while India’s goes into dramatic freefall" - a phenomenon which economists call "[The Great Divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divergence)"

* But, how do we account for this reversal of fortunes?

    - Tharoor believes its because of British depredations & the 'drain theory'

    - Charles' considers the chart to be out-of-date, "overtaken by far more sophisticated modelling"

* India’s decline is not due to British plunder

    - > the ‘drain theory’ could not be proven one way or the other

    - > share of India's national income creamed off by the British Indian elite was too small to matter to Indian economic development either way.

    - > As to the argument that India had to pay through the nose for Britain’s military and civilian services and to cover capital investments, statistics suggest that India would have spent just as much if it had provided its own services. 

* But then why the Indian stagnation?

    - Marathas
    - Declining Mughal Empire

### Our society held us back?

* > The Brahmins produced profound ideas in fields of astronomy, mathematics & metaphysics but largely focused on the divine and the abstract and **restricted the knowledge to the privileged few**.

* > Caste-based hereditary occupations restricted social mobility leading to reduced working capacity and low life expectancy

* > Caste taboos against swimming in or crossing the "kala pani" ensured that India never developed a significant maritime tradition

* > Tharoor rightly criticses the British for their application of a system of apartheid and discrimination but makes no mention of racism already present

* Most useful contribution of British Imperialism

    - > is that it challenged and undermined India’s deeply entrenched conservativism, enabling a newly emergent and increasingly modernising middle class to free itself from the chains of orthodoxy.

    - Various institutions setup for dissemination of "rational knowledge"

* Back to the Nambudris of Kerala

    - Were previously cited for their "damaging impact of caste on Indian society"
    - But were "exceptional thinkers"

    - Were the first "to use infinite series approximations for a range of trigonometric functions"
    - two centuries before the invention of calculus in Europe
    - but the Nambudris kept this to themselves.

### Conclusion

* > History is never black and white, and we owe it to those enlightened Britons who worked for and with Indians to ensure that their role is not airbrushed out of history.

* > Tharoor’s Inglorious Empire may be a good read but it is bad history. 

* > "Remember to be very cynical. All historians when they put out theories have an axe to grind and have a political message. So always ask yourself, what is the political message of this historian you might be reading?" - by [_Prof. Romilla Thapar_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romila_Thapar) (from JNU, cousin of Karan Thapar)
