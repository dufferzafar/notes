> This is a transcript of the YouTube video: [Noam Chomsky - The Educational System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXZuGIMuwQ). The video is from 1991.

_Chomsky was asked the question:_

I'm wondering how you see the role of our educational system, what it's doing right now,what forces are driving it, what constraints are on it and how should it operate?

_Chomsky's reply:_

Well, I quoted the [trilateral commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateral_Commission#Criticisms) view of the educational system; namely it's a system of indoctrination of the young and I think that's correct, it is a system of indoctrination of the young, that was the way the liberal elites regard it and they're more or less accurate.

The educational system is supposed to train people to be obedient conformist, not think too much, do what you're told, stay passive, don't cause any crisis of democracy, don't raise any questions and so on - that's basically what the system is about.

Even the fact that the system has a lot of stupidity in it has a function - it means that people are filtered out for obedience. If you can guarantee lots of stupidity in the educational system, you know, like stupid assignments and things like that. The only people who make it through are people like me and like most of you - who are willing to do it no matter how stupid it is, because we want to go to the next step. So you may know that this assignment is idiotic and the guy up there couldn't think his way out of a paper bag, but you'll do it anyway because that's the way you get to the next class.

Well, there are people who don't do that, people who say I'm not going to do it! It's too ridiculous! Those people are called "behavioral problems" or something like that. They end up in a principal's office or in the streets or selling drugs or whatever and all of this is a technique for selection for obedience.

I don't know how to prove this, but I have a feeling that when you go to the elite universities you find more obedience and conformity, probably because you're getting the students who were better able to do it. All of that is functional, that's the way it works, and it works right through graduate school.

The problem is that you can't have progress this way!

Eespecially in the sciences and engineering, that's a problem because the corporations need science and engineering. If you don't have innovation you're really in trouble, so they have to encourage creativity and independence, because you can't get anywhere if you just copy what somebody told you. You have to be challenging things all the time, challenging everything you know, thinking new thoughts and so on and there you get a real contradiction - it's hard to train people to be creative and challenging and yet to ensure that somewhere else in their lives they're conformist and obedient and never think.

This is a serious problem in Japan, we think of Japan as this tremendous superpower but that's very misleading. Japan, for example, is very poor in science and they're aware of it and part of the reason is the same thing that makes them good workers, obedient workers - it's a very obedient society, very differential, and conformist society and one effect of that is that you you know there are real constraints against independent, free thinking and you see it in the sciences very clearly the but it's a problem here too.

So there are these contradictions and when you get to graduate school they're beginning to show up. They show up much less in the ideological subjects, because there it doesn't matter so much. Profits aren't made by historians having original ideas about the French Revolution, so they can have conventional ideas and that means that the pressure to try to support innovation and freedom is much less, but the pressures for conformity are much greater, because in the ideological subjects it begins to be dangerous if people think the wrong thoughts. It's not so dangerous if they have new ideas about physics.

Nevertheless, you begin to get a little flux in the system by the time you get to graduate school. Even at lower levels, there are teachers who do stimulate thought and sometimes they get away with it. If people are learning things; you can't control them, you can't make them just regurgitate what they heard.

Now there's a lot of pressure to turn the schools into the Marine Corps and there's a lot of support for it, for example, there's this bestseller for the last couple of years by Alan Bloom - [Closing of the American Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Closing_of_the_American_Mind) and there were a lot of enthusiastic accolades for it. He was saying that a couple of smart guys will decide what the great thoughts are and every student will memorize them and that's education. Well, that's a way to turn people into pure automata. I mean even if they happen to pick the greatest thoughts, there is no way less likely to get anybody to think about those thoughts than to make that the curriculum which finishes them off.

But I think that's the purpose really, I mean the purpose is just to impose authority - here's the great thoughts; all those other stuff is rubbish; just learn those and you're okay. I'll pick 'em, you memorize 'em, that's basically the line.

Now of course, that's the opposite of Education; that's the way you study the Talmud or something like that.

The 1960s are now described in the literature as a time when students were running around burning libraries, destroying the foundations of civilization and so on but what was actually going on was that they were asking questions, they were looking into things that people hadn't looked into before, they were not just obedient and from the point of view of a lot of the faculty that's equivalent to burning the buildings. They can't even make that small distinction, and this pressure to turn the schools back to the days when you didn't have to worry about those things like disobedient students asking questions, about things that you didn't tell them to think about.
