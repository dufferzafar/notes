Chapter 0 of the Deep Work book.

## Detailed comments

> "Professional activities" 

 what are some activities of my profession?

Coding? Without internet.
Reading?
Writing? 

> "distraction-free" 

 what distractions do I face?

Telegram, WhatsApp, Messenger
Email

Sometimes I fear picking up my phone because I know there would be something that distracts me from my flow.

One touch notification disable - by groups 

> "current intellectual capacity" 

 how to measure? 

> "more immediate pursuits" 

 so, denote a time of day where you're away from these pursuits ?

And can just focus on something deep 

> "Allen never owned a computer" 

 but there would be many who do own a computer and are still productive. 

> "Instead of a novel that will be around for a long tim" 

 code.

Long form articles.

Things that take research. 

> "bunch of e-mail messages" 

 bunch of GitHub issues and responses.

Bunch of chat messages. 

> "fragmented most knowledge workers' attention into slivers" 

 is this the reason I don't like opening my laptop now a days as I'm so distracted there.

There's just too much to do.

I felt so empty yesterday when there was no internet on laptop. Just didn't want to do anything else.

I like the restricted environment the iPad provides. I can just open an app and read/study.

On laptop it's way too easy to open a new tab and google something and then just get lost. 

> "easy to replicate" 

 anyone can do these!! 

> "Shallow Work" 

 what shallow work do I do? 

> "distracted dashes that produce muted quality" 

 most of good stuff has been produced when I was really focused on the task at hand?

In the flow?

What to watch?
Cmder Setup? 

> "degrading our capacity to remain focused" 

 the laptop isn't an issue.

Internet is.

Mobile phone is - barrage of notifications.

TODO: Setup something automatic for my digital well-being. 

> "we no longer need good memories" 

 I feel this is wrong.

But why, really?

What role does the "GK" subject play in a world where Google & Wikipedia exist? 

> "recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth" 

 all my life, I've been prioritising breadth?

GitHub, HN, Web Skimming.

Haven't read long form books in the past 2-3 years?

Do videos also count as breadth? 

> "his  work  responsibilities  could  be automated by a “kludged together” Excel script." 

 so, deep work is important to prevent machines from taking your job?

Depth is important?

As breadth is easy to come by? 

> "he needed to increase his value to the world" 

 what is my value to the world?

What is my USP?

What is any programmers?

How do you even measure something like this?

Other programmers who have immense value? 

> "explosive career trajectories" 

 security Researcher?

Penetration Testing etc. 

> "requires intense uninterrupted concentration on cognitively demanding concepts" 

 I did this during GATE? 

> "compulsion" 

 i've experienced such compulsion too?

On phone? Quickly chat? 

> "locked myself in a room with no computer: just textbooks, notecards, and a highlighter" 

 comparable to not using the laptop and using a restricted device like iPad.

All I've been doing for the past hour is read and highlight. 

> "if what you're producing is mediocre, then you're in trouble" 

 most of what I've produced is mediocre?

Tiny tools that work only for me. 

All my repos with more stars are the ones where people could see value for themselves. 

> "Deep Work Hypothesis" 

 how can the hypothesis be tested? 

> "This particular professor is hard to reach" 

 so is Knuth. 

> "rarely working past five or six p.m. during the workweek" 

 what did he do after that time?

Personal Projects?

General Life? 

> "invested  significant  effort  to minimize the shallow in my life" 

 what is shallow in my life? 

> "uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration" 

 what does carefully directed mean?

How will I do that? 

> "lack  of  distraction  in  my  life  tones  down  that background hum of nervous mental energy" 

 felt this after quitting reddit? 

Especially /r/India 

> "most productive and important personalities of generations past" 

 programmers who've produced deep work?
