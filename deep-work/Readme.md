## why?

* I want to understand why (& how) some programmers are hyper-productive
    - What is it that they do, that I can too
    - I felt that I haven't done anything that requires real depth

<!-- Like everyone else, I'm troubled by the amount of time I waste on random sites -->

* Some hyper-productive programmers

    - [**Fabrice Bellard**](http://bellard.org/)
        + AV1, ffmpeg, QEMU
        + JSLinux
        + Multiple obfuscated C wins
        + Formulae for Pi

        + Studied at "Ecole Polytechnique" (poincare!)

        + O'Reilly Open Source Award

        + Pecularities
            * Not on any social media (?)

    - [**Dan Luu**](https://danluu.com/about/)

        + In-depth posts
            * "half low-level technical stuff, and half general-interest topics for programmers"
            * Filled with lots of research

        + Jobs
            * Machine Learning @ Google
            * Bing @ Microsoft

* `TODO`: Find more amazing people!
    - https://github.com/rekihattori/awesome-programmers

## todo

* Read interviews by these programmers
    - Send them emails?

* Look at what software engineering papers have to say on this?
    - Fred Brooks etc.
