## Goal

* Measure a govt's "progress" score
    * Use data to answer the 
        * What has improved under the current regime?
        * What has gotten worse?

    * Compare metrics across 5-year boundaries

    * Compare Delhi with nearby NCR cities
        * Haryana: Gurgaon, Faridabad
        * Uttar Pradesh: Noida, Ghaziabad

* Delhi subsidy programme specific questions
    * How are the current subsidies being financed?
    * Where is the "extra" money coming from?
    * Where was it being used under previous govts?

    * Delhi Govt did a survey to praise the program in 2020
